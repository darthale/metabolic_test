    <h2>Page 9: Physiological Potential and Oxidative Stress Index OS-I (continued)</h2>

    <p>The stroke volume decreases purely due to the increasing contraction, meaning the heart is no longer able to fill the full range of motion. This implies, conversely, that the potential amount of oxygen that the heart can maximally deliver is also limited.</p>

    <p>The two maximum values of stroke volume and maximum oxygen pulse result in the so-called "COR" zone. COR stands for Cardial Optimum Range, thus marking the heart's response spectrum in which it can act between its maximum stroke force up to the maximum oxygen transport.</p>

    <p>These two maximum values can be used in training to specifically train the heart as a muscle, for example through HIT intervals, which accelerate the pulse up to the PO2 maximum and corresponding pause times that allow it to return to the maximum stroke volume.</p>

    <p>If one designs training in this mode, one can determine when the maximum stimulus for the moment is set based on the heart's reaction after the exertion: if the heart no longer returns to the maximum stroke volume after the exertion in the previously determined time interval, the maximum, muscular stimulus is set for now.</p>

    <p>The same principle applies here as with strength training: if the muscles are exhausted, further repetitions will no longer lead to greater training progress, but will only massively prolong recovery times or even cause damage.</p>

    <h2>Page 10: Physiological Potential and Oxidative Stress Index OS-I</h2>

    <p>The question of how great the remaining potential for physiological development is often stands at the center of performance diagnostics and is anything but easy to answer. The reason for this is the complexity of the human body and the general physiology of endurance: to make the body sustainably more capable, it takes far more than muscular input and waiting for adaptation.</p>

    <p>In our diagnostics, we therefore examine four different factors, which we place under the viewpoint of basic endurance, i.e., the basis for endurance performances. However, the potential present here can only be evaluated at the current status quo, which means that depending on training quality and scope, it can certainly happen that the potential shifts and changes with each diagnostic.</p>

    <p>To facilitate the capturing of potential, we work with four quadrants, which are also visualized and which represent two constants and two variables.</p>

    <div class="zone-box">
        <div class="zone-title">1. Constant: Muscular Work</div>
        <p>The status quo at the muscular level is defined here by the point from which a clearly measurable exertion was recognized in the body: the VT1. This first point shows up to which load the body can still work without muscular stressors.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="zone-box">
        <div class="zone-title">2. Constant: Subjective Perception</div>
        <p>Even if this point is naturally not completely quantifiable, the subjective assessment of the fatigue perception on the Borg scale gives an impression of how a performance would be evaluated approximately. Another term for this is the concept of "RPE", which stands for Rating of Perceived Exertion. With this method, a classification of the existing load is usually made on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 means a hardly noticeable, absolutely loose intensity and 10 the absolute maximum. The subjective constant of potential is set at an intensity of RPE 4. Since it is not equally easy for everyone to classify themselves here, the juxtaposition of VT1 with RPE 4 provides a concrete reference point for how to sustainably train body awareness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="zone-box">
        <div class="zone-title">1. Variable: Metabolic Work</div>
        <p>By metabolic work, in this context, we understand the body's ability to act without increasing metabolic stress. Specifically, this point refers to the end of the FatMax range, as this marks the point from which the active use of oxygen for energy provision begins to measurably decrease. This point is referred to as the cellular stress threshold CST. The potential present here measured at the current status quo shows how close the CST is to VT1 and to what percentage this potential has already been exploited. It is important to understand here that this value can certainly exceed 100% in well-trained athletes, as it sometimes occurs that FatMax already lies above VT1.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="zone-box">
        <div class="zone-title">2. Variable: Cardiovascular Reaction</div>
        <p>The cardiovascular reaction to muscular performance shows the current heart rate at VT1. Here, on the linearly same scale, it is calculated by what percentage the heart could still become stronger until it has reached the corresponding exhaustion. Here too, it is possible, depending on heart performance, to be already so well trained that the potential has already been exceeded from a mathematical perspective. This is not negative in this case, but indicates that the heart is as healthy and capable as it can be.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chart">
        <img src="/api/placeholder/500/400" alt="Physiological Potential Quadrant Chart">
    </div>

    <p>In our report, these four factors and quadrants are presented in such a way that they can be recognized and grasped at a glance: the rectangle executed in gray marks the potential available at the time of testing, the lines held in color, often forming a trapezoid, show the status quo.</p>

    <p>Combined with the metabolic profile, these numbers result in a powerful tool for training design as well as the possibility to directly recognize in a follow-up test whether the desired training success has also occurred.</p>

    <p>As a further aid serves the OS-I, which can be used in a final instance to determine the training volume and also to define the methodology more precisely.</p>

    <h2>Page 11: Oxidative Stress Index and Training Volume</h2>

    <p>One of the most important factors around endurance training is the balance of stress factors. Simply put, our body responds to stress always in only one way: it releases stress hormones. It is irrelevant what type the trigger is: physical, mental, emotional, metabolic, or oxidative stress... the list is long. At the same time, however, it immediately becomes very complex, as the stress hormones can interact with the original stressors in different ways.</p>

    <p>In connection with sports, oxidative stress is one of the most important aspects, which we can also quantify at the same time.</p>

    <p>It is important to understand here that oxygen absorbed in the body does not necessarily mean that it can also be used at the cellular level. That is: a high VO2Max does not per se mean good oxygen utilization (for simplicity's sake, this is equated with FatMax, as it is an objective parameter for how our cells work with oxygen).</p>

    <p>The relationship between oxygen absorbed and processed in the body determines how large the load caused by training can be in 24 hours, so that there is still sufficient time for real recovery. This load time depends on the following factors:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The basic turnover of oxygen in 24 hours as well as in the flow rate of mL/min (VO2Rest)</li>
        <li>The VO2Max as absolute and relative parameters (mL/min and mL/min/kg)</li>
        <li>The ratio of VO2Rest to VO2Max</li>
        <li>The ratio of absorbed vs. used oxygen at the maximum value (FatMax)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>From these values, the maximum oxygen tolerance in the body can be calculated. This Oxidative Stress Index (OS-I) can help to determine the general training condition of an athlete and also be used to estimate the maximum training times, depending on intensities, that the body can absorb at the time of the test without being overloaded at the level of oxygen uptake.</p>

    <p>The OS-I typically ranges from a sub-0 value to 5.x: For beginners or athletes who still show a lot of physical potential, it may happen that it is not advisable to exceed the basic oxygen uptake by more than 20 or even just 10%. For elite amateurs and/or professional athletes, this amount can increase to up to 500% and in rare cases even beyond.</p>

    <p>For the calculation of the mentioned maximum training times, besides the OS-I, the metabolic performance in form of the carbohydrate requirement is also taken into account. Here it is understood that individual exceptions and characteristics can always mean a deviation from the base calculation, which is why these numbers should be understood as guidelines.</p>

    <div class="chart">
        <img src="imgs/training-times-chart.png" alt="Maximum Recommended Training Times Chart">
    </div>

    <p>The underlying calculation includes the CarbMax value, which takes into account that the stress on the energy metabolism and the associated depletion of glycogen stores have a direct influence on recovery times. Specifically, this means that after a corresponding performance and load, not only an oxidative recovery time is necessary, but also the caloric deficit must first be balanced before a new training stimulus should be set.</p>

    <p>It also needs to be considered here that the calculated times do not include work loads or other disciplines. In combination with corresponding measurements (such as a coupling test), very objective steps for optimal planning can be taken.</p>

    <h2>Page 12: Potential Energy Reserves and Glycogen Stores</h2>

    <p>Besides muscular endurance, cardiovascular work, and energy provision at the cellular level, performance is ultimately dependent on how much energy is available in the form of stores and carbohydrates to be absorbed at the targeted performance.</p>

    <p>To get an impression of this, it helps to consider the potential glycogen stores. With the help of bioimpedance analysis BIA, we can measure the various body compartments and determine how large the skeletal muscle mass SMM is. The SMM is that part of the musculature that is directly involved in movement. Glycogen stored in the muscles can only be burned in the respective muscle, as this form of energy consists of molecules that are too large to be transferred from one cell to another. Somewhat crudely expressed, this means that for running, for example, it hardly matters how well our stores in the chest musculature are filled, as this energy can only be consumed there.</p>

    <p>To calculate the amount of available energy, our overview table helps. Depending on the body and eating habits as well as specific training, between 10 and 25 grams of glycogen per kilo SMM can be stored. However, it should be considered here that the theoretical upper limit of 25g is found mainly in professional athletes, but is hardly ever really fulfilled there, as the body is regularly moved even before a competition. However, the table can be very well used as an overview to estimate how much potential energy is available depending on the sport.</p>

    <p>Besides the pure energy available for general movement, the percentage participation of the musculature in the movement plays a big role. Here, our table present in the report can help to estimate this: depending on the sport, the average share of the load on upper body, core (torso), and legs is correspondingly shown (it is understood that here too mainly general values are listed and individual mobility, musculature, nutrition, and coordination can always lead to exceptions).</p>

    <p>Combined with the tabular overview of the energy distribution in the training zones as well as the basic metabolism, a good, theoretical overview can be created, which helps to calculate the energy stores and plan nutrition in training and competition.</p>

    <p>In connection with pacing strategies, corresponding calculations should definitely be tested in training and subsequently refined. This way, one's own body can be better and better understood and read over time!</p>

    <p>We wish you much success in training and in your races and look forward to welcoming you back soon!</p>
